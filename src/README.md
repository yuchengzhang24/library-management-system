# Assignment Source Code

This is where all of your source code should go for assignments. You should not be putting files anywhere else in your repo.

Here is some more information you might want to to include in your Code Style.

- your name and student ID
- the structure of your program (both file organization and high-level functional organization)
- the status of your program (e.g. it works completely, it compiles but doesn't run, it compiles and runs but doesn't work in certain cases, some features are missing etc.)
- what hardware platform(s) you tested it on.  
- how to compile the program (e.g. "run 'make my-hw1-solution' using the submitted makefile") and how to run it.
- any other information that you want to communicate with the graders and other reviewers of your submission
